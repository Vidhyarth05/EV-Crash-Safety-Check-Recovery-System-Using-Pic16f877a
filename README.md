# EV-Crash-Safety-Check-Recovery-System-Using-Pic16f877a
This project is a microcontroller-based safety system designed for Electric Vehicles (EVs) using a PIC16F877A. It monitors the battery voltage, temperature, and motor current to detect potential hazards after a crash and prevent further damage.
